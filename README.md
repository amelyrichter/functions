MPS CD @ Parsons – Typography & Interaction 2 – Final Project 

This is a tool that helps you keep track of exhibitions you want to see before they close.  
Add a museum, exhibition title, and end date — and it’ll show up as a colorful countdown box.  

Your entries are saved in `localStorage`, so there's no need to log in. Just add, check, and go see that art.  
Designed mobile-first with playful styling, poster-inspired layout, and a focus on simplicity.

Built with: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
Made for: my Web Functions capstone project at Parsons
